# Two-sample test with missing data

For the two-sample problem with partially paired data, Fong and others (2018) proposed weighted linear combinations of the test statistics comparing all four paired and unpaired subsamples, using weights inversely proportional to their variances. While the classical approaches only focus on comparing the paired and the independent subsamples. In this letter, we find that the classical approach using weights inversely proportional to their variances can be a powerful alternative to the newly proposed test statistics. Practitioners may apply the classical approach using weights inversely proportional to their variances due to its simplicity and relatively good performance, especially when the correlation between the two samples is high.
